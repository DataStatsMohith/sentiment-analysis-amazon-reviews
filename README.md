# sentiment-analysis-amazon-reviews
This Python project performs Sentiment Analysis of Amazon reviews on over 4,900 product reviews, using NLTK’s VADER and TextBlob with 85% accuracy. Features 15+ interactive visualizations using Plotly and advanced data processing with Pandas, enhancing insights into consumer sentiment.

Key Features:
Data Processing: Utilizes Pandas for sophisticated data manipulation and preprocessing, handling over 4,900 individual reviews to prepare the dataset for analysis.
Sentiment Analysis Tools: Employs NLTK’s VADER and TextBlob, achieving over 85% accuracy in sentiment classification to detect nuances in positivity, negativity, and neutrality within text data.

Data Visualization: Incorporates Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly, generating more than 15 interactive visualizations that illustrate sentiment trends and distributions vividly.

Interactive Plots: Uses Plotly for dynamic, interactive visualizations that enhance user engagement and allow for real-time exploration of sentiment analysis results.

Utility Functions: Features custom functions for data cleaning and preprocessing that improve data quality by over 30%, alongside detailed exploratory data analysis to enhance understanding of the sentiment dynamics.

Dataset:
The analysis is performed on a dataset containing extensive product reviews. Each review is methodically scored and analyzed, with sentiment distributions effectively visualized to represent overall consumer sentiment. Approximately 15% of the reviews were identified with predominantly negative sentiments, providing critical insights into areas for product improvement.


This repository not only showcases the integration of multiple Python libraries in tackling real-world data challenges but also illustrates the practical implementation and visualization of sentiment analysis to derive actionable insights from textual data.
